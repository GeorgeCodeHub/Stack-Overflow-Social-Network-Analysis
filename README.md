# Stack-Overflow-Social-Network-Analysis
This project aims to analyze a Stack Overflow time-varying network with Python. 

Data were obtained from the following source: [Stanford-data](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/sx-stackoverflow.html)

More specifically, methods were applied that allowed us to:
- the visualization of large data sets in graphs
- splitting them into subscribers by time periods
- the graphical presentation of distribution values for centralization measures for each sub-signature.
- the calculation of common data sets for successive signatures
- calculation of similarity tables in the above sets.
- forecast of future edges according to similarity tables.

**Note**: An initiative was taken to adopt guided graphs based on the need to calculate In-Degree and Out-Degree Centralities.

Below a few images showcasing the calculation of some sub graphs, Centrality Measures and similarity tables:
